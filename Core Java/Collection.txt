in-memory databases
	- these db they do not store data in the secondary, it is available in primary		`
	- h2 database

1. add the h2 depenceny in pom.xml
2. change the connection url in DBUtil
3. change the username and password, default is sa and no password
4. change the driver to be loaded, org.h2.Driver
5. access the h2-console to create the DB and necessary tables

arrays vs Collection - interview question

Collection in Java - hold objects
		   - any primitives added to a collection is converted to its equivalent wrapper type and vice versa
		   - this is possible bacuse of auto-concept in java

int[] marks = new int[5]; ----> array, fixed size , indexed

List al = new ArrayList(); -----> Collection, not fixed size, not all collections are indexed
al.add(10);
al.add(50);
al.add(5);






List al = new ArrayList();
al.add(10);
al.add(50);
al.add(5);

System.out.println(al.get(2)); ----> 5



List
	- is indexed
	- retains the order in which the objects were added
	- allows multiple null values
	- allows duplicate values

Set
	- is not indexed, no get() method
	- does not retain the order, random order
	- does not allow duplicate values to be added
	- allows one null value
	- everytime when an object is added it calls equals() to check for duplicates

SortedSet
	- follows all rules imposed by Set because it is an extension of Set + extra
	- it sorts the objects added to it by calling the compareTo method of the object that was added
	- which means any object added to a SortedSet implementation should implement Comparable interface

Queue
	- follows queue algorithm, Last In Last out(LILO) or First In First Out(FIFO)
	- any object added is added to the rear
	- any object removed is removed from the head
	- not indexed
	- allows duplicate values


Map
	- works with keys and values
	- no duplicate keys
	- can have duplicate values

SortedMap
	- follows all rules imposed by Map because it is an Extension of Map + extra
	- it sorts the entries of the map in the order of the key
	- which means any object added as a key to the TreeSet implementation should implement Comparable interface
