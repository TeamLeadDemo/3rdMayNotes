Reflection api

Assignments
------------
1) stimulate the javap command
	- introspect a class and this class name should be given as input by the user
		- introspection is done in 2 steps
			- get hold of the class object representation of the class name provided as input
			- call the various different methods of the class object to print an output similar to javap's output
	- sample input - reflectiondemo.Room (or) java.lang.Integer 
		       - either through Scanner or as a commandline argument
 	- ouput - similar to what you get when you run the javap command

2) stimulate a testing framework's annotations

@Test - @MyTest
@Before
@After


@Test
public void addTestPositive(){
}

3) custom logging framework - may not be reflection
			    - understand how log4j works




first step 
	- obtain a Class object of what you are trying to introspect

	- 3 main ways
fields
constructors
methods
