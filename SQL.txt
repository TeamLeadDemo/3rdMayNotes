So, in summary, the different types of database keys are:

Natural key: an attribute that can uniquely identify a row, and exists in the real world.
Surrogate key: an attribute that can uniquely identify a row, and does not exist in the real world.
Composite key: more than one attribute that when combined can uniquely identify a row.
Primary key: the single unique identifier for the row.
Candidate key: an attribute that could be the primary key.
Alternate key: a candidate key that is not the primary key.
Unique key: an attribute that can be unique on the table. Can also be called an alternate key.
Foreign key: an attribute that is used to refer to another record in another table.
