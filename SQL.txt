RDB - Relational Databases
RDBMS - Relational Database Management System
	- eg : Oracle, Postgres, SQLServer, MySql etc

databases, tables, rows/records, columns


student_details(table)
stud_id		stud_name	stud_mark
101		ABC		60
102		XYZ		50

SQL - Structured Querying Language, 
    - compiled and executed

ANSII SQL - standard followed by all sql DB software vendors
dialect - 

ORM - Object Relational Mapping (dont have to worry about this in week2) -Spring Data , Hibernate, Ibatis

5 Categories of SQL queries
	- DDL (Data Definition Language)
		- deal with the structure of the table
		- create, alter, drop, truncate
	- DML (Data Manipulation Language)
		- deal with the data in the table
		- insert, update, delete
	- DQL (Data Querying Language)
		- select
	- TCL (Transaction Control language)
		- commit, rollback, savepoints
	- DCL (Data Control language)
		- granting and revoking priveliges to the users
		- grant, revoke

Constraints
Normalization, ACID properties for transactions -very strong interview question
PL/SQL - stored procedure, functions, triggers


So, in summary, the different types of database keys are:

Natural key: an attribute that can uniquely identify a row, and exists in the real world.
Surrogate key: an attribute that can uniquely identify a row, and does not exist in the real world.
Composite key: more than one attribute that when combined can uniquely identify a row.
Primary key: the single unique identifier for the row.
Candidate key: an attribute that could be the primary key.
Alternate key: a candidate key that is not the primary key.
Unique key: an attribute that can be unique on the table. Can also be called an alternate key.
Foreign key: an attribute that is used to refer to another record in another table.

meta commands in postgres
--------------------------
\l - lists all the databases
\dt - list all the tables in the current database that you are connected to
\c - connect to a particular database
