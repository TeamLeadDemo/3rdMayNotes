subquery
	- when a query works on an unknow value/ computed value, we use subquery to compute that value
	- inner query(sub query) and outter query
	- here first the inner query executes and returns a value/list of values and then the outer query works on that value.

corelated subquery
	- for every record of the outer query , the inner query works


views
------


CREATE VIEW comedies AS
    SELECT *
    FROM films
    WHERE kind = 'Comedy';


SELECT * FROM comedies;

Index
------

	- generally column which are very frequently used in the where clause
	- can create indexes on more than one column( maybe the where clause frequently works with those 2 column together)
